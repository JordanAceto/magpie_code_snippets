## Description

This example uses the I2C Master to control the gain of the AFE via MAX14662 analog switch. It is for the Magpie custom hardware and runs on a MAX32666 microcontroller.


## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes
- This example requires the Magpie hardware stack to be assembled and the AFE installed.

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1..

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
******** I2C AFE GAIN MUX EXAMPLE *********

This example rotates through the various gain setting of the MAX14662 AFE gain MUX
Uses I2C0 (SCL - P0.6, SDA - P0.7).
-->I2C Master Initialization Complete

Setting gain to:   0x40
Reading gain back: 0x40

Setting gain to:   0x01
Reading gain back: 0x01

Setting gain to:   0x08
Reading gain back: 0x08

Setting gain to:   0x40
Reading gain back: 0x40

Setting gain to:   0x01
Reading gain back: 0x01

... the gain pattern repeats ...
```

If there is a problem writing or reading to the MAX14662, or if the gain written does not match the gain that is read back, then an error message will be shown in the terminal.
