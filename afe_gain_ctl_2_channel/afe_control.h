/**
 * @file      afe_gain_ctl.h
 * @brief     A software module for controlling the Analog Front End (AFE) is represented here.
 * @details   The gain is set by switching resistors in a differential opamp circuit. Eight discrete gain settings are
 * available. AFE channels are enabled and disabled via load switches controlled by GPIO pins.
 *
 * This module requires:
 * - Exclusive use of P0.11 and P0.12
 * - Shared use of I2C0 using 7-bit addresses 0x4E and 0x4F
